# git-intro


Cloned the professors repo and then create the wage_age.csv file using matplotlib and numpy. Then pushing it to github.
git-intro

A demo repository for assignment submission.
updating a repo

First clone it.

git clone <url from the github.com GUI>

Then work on stuff locally and update it.

git add .
git commit -m "some informative message about what I did"
git push origin main

Add a .gitignore file to keep things from getting pushed to github.
Reproducibility

Download the source CSV from the ISLR2 website with the following command

make data

    You need to do this when you first clone the repo because CSV files are .gitignored.
    If you make a local copy of a dataset, be sure to provide appropriate attribution.
    Be very clear about anything you did to process the data.
    Results must be reproducible. Provide clear instructions for every step.
    One nice thing about make is that you can edit the Makefile without having to edit this README.
    One annoying thing about make is that indents in the Makefile must be tabs -- spaces don't work.
    If you don't have make then you're probably using Windows. If so, consider Cygwin.

Presenting results

Here's the first chart in Figure 1.1 of ISLR2.

This demonstrates another way to embed a PNG...

Recreate this chart with

make app

requirements

I created the requirements.txt by first running this command

conda list -e > requirements.txt

Then I edited it to include only the modules that I imported in my code, along with the python version.

conda list -e > requirements.txt

You can use the requirements.txt to create a conda environment and run code as follows:

conda create --name demo --file requirements.txt
conda activate demo
make app
conda deactivate

github pages

    github pages
    Activate a github-pages site for a repository in Settings > Pages
    I do NOT recommend using Jekyll for this class.

seaborn issue

For some reason (python not installed as a framework?), plt.show() with seaborn hangs my terminal. Fix this by turning off interactive mode:

plt.ioff()

You can also fix this by using a different backend:

matplotlib.use('TkAgg')

List all the backends and the current backend with:

print(plt.get_backend())
print(matplotlib.rcsetup.all_backends)

Or, to avoid using matplotlib, add the following to ~/.zprofile:

# Avoids seaborn hang on my old macbook pro
export MPLBACKEND=qtagg
